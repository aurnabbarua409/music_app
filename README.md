# music_app (Need a lot of modification)

A new Flutter project. If you can modify, do it. I have kept a lot of bugs in this project willingly. Find them and solve like a puzzle game. You may find some, others are hidden. 
** A little hint: To find the hidden bugs, act like a user. 

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
